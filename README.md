# ðŸŽ¯ Objective
The objective of this project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of customer purchase behavior, with a specific focus on purchase amounts, in relation to customer gender during the Black Friday sales event at Walmart Inc. This study aims to provide valuable insights that can assist the management team at Walmart Inc. in making data-driven decisions.

# About the Data
The company collected the transactional data of customers who purchased products from the Walmart Stores during Black Friday.It has information of about 0.5 Million transactions during Black Friday throughout various years.

# Business Recommendations
- To increase sales, the company should implement strategies tailored to both genders, considering that men generally spend more. While targeting male customers, it's essential not to overlook females by offering
discounts and special offers.
- since the age group of 51-55 demonstrates higher spending, allocating more resources to attract customers from other age brackets is crucial.
- Certain product categories, such as 19, 20, and 13, show minimal purchase activity. Considering dropping these categories could streamline inventory and resource allocation, optimizing overall operations
- Moreover, the analysis reveals a significant frequency of purchase orders falling within the 5k to 10k range.
- Focusing efforts on promoting and enhancing the appeal of products within this mid-range price segment can potentially drive higher sales and revenue
